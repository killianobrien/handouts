\topic{Reading notes on Chapter 6: Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem}

In chapter 4 on cyclic groups you proved in theorem 4.10 that every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic (i.e. generated by a single element) and moreover, in theorem 4.13, that the order of any element of a cyclic group divides the order of the group.

This latter result generalises to the famous Lagrange's Theorem, which says that in any finite group $G$, the order of any subgroup of $G$ is always a divisor of the order of $G$.
